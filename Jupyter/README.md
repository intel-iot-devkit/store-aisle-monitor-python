## Introduction

This reference implementation counts the number of people present in an image and generates a motion heatmap. It takes the input from the camera, or a video file for processing. Snapshots of the output are taken at regular intervals and are uploaded to the cloud. It also stores the snapshots of the output locally.

## Requirements

### Hardware
*  6th to 8th generation Intel® Core™ processors with Intel® Iris® Pro graphics or Intel® HD Graphics

### Software

* [Ubuntu* 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/)
* OpenCL™ Runtime Package<br>
  **Note**: We recommend using a 4.14+ kernel to use this software. Run the following command to determine your kernel version:
  ```  
  uname -a
  ```  
* Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit 2020 R3 Release
* Microsoft Azure* Python SDK

## How it Works
- The application uses a video source, such as a camera or a video file, to grab the frames. The [OpenCV functions](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dd/d43/tutorial_py_video_display.html) are used to calculate frame width, frame height and frames per second (fps) of the video source. The application counts the number of people and generates motion heatmap.

-  People counter: A trained neural network model detects the people in the frame and bounding boxes are drawn on the people detected. This reference implementation uses a pre-trained model **person-detection-retail-0013** that can be downloaded using the **model downloader**, provided by the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit.

- Motion Heatmap generation: An accumulated frame is used, on which every frame is added after preprocessing. This accumulated frame is used to generate the motion heatmap using [applyColorMap](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d3/d50/group__imgproc__colormap.html#gadf478a5e5ff49d8aa24e726ea6f65d15). The original frame and heatmap frame are merged using [addWeighted](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_core/py_image_arithmetics/py_image_arithmetics.html), to visualize the movement patterns over time.

-  The heatmap frame and people counter frame are merged using [addWeighted](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_core/py_image_arithmetics/py_image_arithmetics.html) and this merged frame is saved locally at regular intervals. The output is present in the *output_snapshots* directory of the project directory.

-  The application also uploads the results to the Microsoft Azure cloud at regular intervals, if a Microsoft Azure storage name and key are provided.

## Setup

### Install Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit

Refer to [https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/OpenVINO-Install-Linux](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/OpenVINO-Install-Linux) for more information on how to install and setup the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit.

The OpenCL™ Runtime package is required to run the inference on a GPU. It is not mandatory for CPU inference.

### Other dependencies
**Microsoft Azure python SDK**<br>
The Azure python SDK allows you to build applications against Microsoft Azure Storage. [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction) is Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. Azure Storage offers a massively scalable object store for data objects, a file system service for the cloud, a messaging store for reliable messaging, and a NoSQL store.



### Which model to use

This application uses the [**person-detection-retail-0013**](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2020.3/_models_intel_person_detection_retail_0013_description_person_detection_retail_0013.html) Intel® pre-trained model, that can be accessed using the **model downloader**. The **model downloader** downloads the __.xml__ and __.bin__ files that will be used by the application.

To download the model and install the dependencies of the application, run the below command in the `store-aisle-monitor-python` directory:
```
./setup.sh
```

### The Config File

The _resources/config.json_ contains the path of video that will be used by the application as input.

For example:
   ```
   {
       "inputs": [
          {
              "video":"path_to_video/video1.mp4"
          }
       ]
   }
   ```

The `path/to/video` is the path to an input video file.

### Which Input Video to use

We recommend using [store-aisle-detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/master/store-aisle-detection.mp4).
For example:
   ```
   {
       "inputs": [
          {
              "video":"sample-videos/store-aisle-detection.mp4
          }
       ]
   }
   ```
If the user wants to use any other video, it can be used by providing the path in the config.json file.


### Using the Camera Stream instead of video

Replace `path/to/video` with the camera ID in the config.json file, where the ID is taken from the video device (the number X in /dev/videoX).

On Ubuntu, to list all available video devices use the following command:

```
ls /dev/video*
```

For example, if the output of above command is __/dev/video0__, then config.json would be:

```
  {
     "inputs": [
        {
           "video":"0"
        }
     ]
  }
```

### Setup the environment

Configure the environment to use the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit one time per session by running the following command:

    source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh

**Note:** This command needs to be executed only once in the terminal where the application will be executed. If the terminal is closed, the command needs to be executed again.


### Run the application on Jupyter*

Go to the store-aisle-monitor-python directory and open the Jupyter notebook by running the following commands:

```
cd <path_to_the_store-aisle-monitor-python_directory>/Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

#### Follow the steps to run the code on Jupyter*:

   ```    
7. To run the application on sync mode, export the environment variable **%env FLAG = sync**. By default, the application runs on async mode.
8. Copy the code from **store_aisle_monitor_jupyter.py** and paste it in the next cell and press **Shift+Enter**.

9. Alternatively, code can be run in the following way:

    i. Click on the **store_aisle_monitor_jupyter.ipynb** notebook file from the Jupyter notebook home window.
    
    ii. Click on the **Kernel** menu and then select **Restart & Run All** from the drop down list.
    
    iii. On the pop-up window, click on **Restart and Run All Cells**.
